This is my Project I. First time made a video game.
To use this project:
-Download Unity hub
-Open Unityhub and Add the project folder from disk. Make sure it's right path.
-Download Unity Editor version 2021.3.18f1 and run this project.
I'm not sure that the project can run correctly when using another version of Unity Editor
